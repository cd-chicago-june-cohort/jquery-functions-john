            <h2><strong>Click HERE for a timeline of Richard Feynman's life:</strong></h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1918 - </strong>Born in Queens, New York.  Feynman grew up in Far Rockaway, New York, where he took an early interest in mathematics, electronics, and thinking.
                <li><strong>1939 - </strong>Recieved his bachelor's degree in physics from MIT. As an undergraduate, Feynman excelled in math and physics, got two papers published in the Physical Review, and became deeply interested in quantum mechanics.  He also became known among his peers as an eclectic personality with a bizarre sense of humor.</li>
                <li><strong>1942 - </strong>Recieved his PhD in physics from Princeton.  Feynman's doctoral advisor was the renouned physicist John Wheeler, and he also met such great minds as John von Neumann and Albert Einstein.</li>
                <li>In June of '42 Feynman married his highschool sweetheart, Arline Greenbaum, despite knowing she was terminally ill with tuberculosis.  She would succumb to the disease in June of 1945.  Richard would late remarry twice.</li>
                <li><strong>1943 - </strong>In the middle of World War II, Feynman was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, the top secret team of physicists and engineers who created the atomic bomb in New Mexico.  Initially, Richard was opposed to working on a bomb capable of murdering tens of thousands of people at once, but he eventually talked himself into it.  He reasoned that if Hitler developed the bomb first, civilization and all that he holds dear would be gone forever.</li>
                <li>Becuase Feynamn was so young, he was not a lead physicist on the Manhattan Project, and most of his time was spent crunching numbers.  To keep his curiosity satiated, he started recreationally picking locks and cracking safes.  He eventually became so good at this that he was known throughout the project as "Feynman the Safe Cracker".</li>
                <li><strong>1946 - </strong>Accepted a full-time professorship at Cornell University.  At Cornell he began the work the would ultimately lead to his revieving the Nobel Prize in Physics.</li>
                <li><strong>1952 - </strong>Moved from Cornell to Caltech because he wanted warmer weather.  He would stay at Caltech for the rest of his career.</li>
                <li>Over the next 36 years he did a lot of physics and got a lot of things with his name on them (equations, theorems, diagrams, etc.).  He was also a well known percussionist, artist, and author.</li>
                <li><strong>1988 - </strong>Died from complications related to a rare cancer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="quote">"Feynman made science so fascinating.  He reminded us how much fun it is and everybody can have a pretty full understanding.  He was such a joyful example of how we'd all like to learn and to think about things."   -Bill Gates</h3>
